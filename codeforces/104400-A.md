# A. Playf and ABC

**Time limit per test:** 1 second  
**Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes  
**Input:** standard input  
**Output:** standard output  

## Problem Statement

Playf has a string $S$ with length $n$, which only contains three types of letters A, B, and C. She wants to find some triples $(i, j, k)$ where $0 \leq i < j < k < n$, such that either:

- $\overline{S_{i}S_{j}S_{k}} = ABC$ (when read normally), or 
- $\overline{S_{i}S_{j}S_{k}} = CBA$ (when read normally)

However, Playf does not want each character to be used repeatedly, so the index of each character appears in at most one triple.

Playf wants to know how many triples she can find at most.

## Input

The first line contains a string $S$ $(1 \leq |S| \leq 3\times10^5)$.

## Output

Print an integer, the maximum number of triples Playf can find.

## Examples

### Input
```
ABCBBAC
```
### Output
```
2
```

### Input
```
ABCBBACCA
```
### Output

### Input
```
BACABA
```
### Output
```
1
```

## Note

For the first example, two triples are $(0,1,6)$ and $(2,3,5)$. There might be other set of two triples, but Playf can not find more than 2 triples in this example.
